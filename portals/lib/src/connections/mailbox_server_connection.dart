/// A connection to a mailbox server.
///
/// The server doesn't really do anything except offering "mailboxes", which
/// clients can connect to. Mailboxes are identified using large ids. Clients
/// can send messages to a mailbox, which will then get sent to everyone
/// connected to that mailbox.
/// In order to make the communication between the clients easier, there are
/// nameplates. Nameplates are short strings that point to a single mailbox and
/// can be claimed and released by clients.
/// Typically, one client allocates and claims a nameplate. Then, the nameplate
/// is transcribed to the second client, which also claims the nameplate to
/// retrieve the id of the connected mailbox. Now, both clients can connect to
/// the mailbox using the large id. Also, they can release the nameplate to
/// allow other clients to reuse the nameplate for another mailbox.
///

/// for allocating, claiming and releasing nameplates, opening and closing
/// mailboxes and sending and receiving messages.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This package is still in technical preview**.
The API may change substantially in the future and it's not safe to use this package in production yet ‚Äì several features like reconnecting when the network is lost, or using a transfer server if the two devices can't see each other still need to be implemented.

## Features

‚ù§Ô∏è **Easy to use:**
Portals connect by letting users transcribe short human-readable codes from one device to another.
TODO: There's a beautiful pre-built UI for Flutter.

üîí **Secure:**
Strong end-to-end encryption using Spake2 is built in.
Man-in-the-middle attacks are virtually impossible because both sides share a secret from the beginning.

‚ö° **Fast:**
Data is transferred using peer-to-peer connections whenever possible.
That makes portals incredibly fast when used on the same wifi or in the same geographic area.

üéà **Lightweight:**
There are no native dependencies.
That also means, portals work anywhere where Dart runs: on mobile, desktop & the web.
Portals use lightweight WebSockets to communicate.

## How to use

To connect two devices, you need to create a portal on each of them.

```dart
var portal = Portal(appId: 'my.app.example.com');
```

On the first device, open the portal. It will return a phrase that uniquely identifies it:

```dart
String phrase = await portal.open();
// TODO: Show the phrase to the user.
String key = await portal.waitForLink();
```

Let the user transcribes the `phrase` to the second user in the real world.
The second user can then link the two portals:

```dart
// TODO: Let the user enter the phrase.
String key = await portal.openAndLinkTo(phrase);
```

Now the two portals are linked.
Optionally, you can let the users compare the `key` to completely rule out man-in-the-middle attacks.

In the background, both clients try to establish a peer-to-peer connection to each other.
Wait for it on both sides by calling:

```dart
await portal.waitUntilReady();
```

Now, anything that goes into one of the two portals comes out the other.

```dart
portal.add(something);
var somethingElse = await portal.receive();
```

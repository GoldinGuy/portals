‚ö†Ô∏è **This package is still in technical preview**.
The API may change substantially in the future and it's not safe to use this package in production yet ‚Äì several features like reconnecting when the network is lost, or using a transfer server if the two devices can't see each other still need to be implemented.

Portals are strongly encrypted peer-to-peer connections.

## Features

‚ù§Ô∏è **Easy to use:**
Portals connect by letting users transcribe short human-readable codes from one device to another.
TODO: There's a beautiful pre-built UI for Flutter.

üîí **Secure:**
Strong end-to-end encryption using Spake2 is built in.
Man-in-the-middle attacks are virtually impossible because both sides share a secret from the beginning.

‚ö° **Fast:**
Data is transferred using peer-to-peer connections whenever possible.
That makes portals incredibly fast when used on the same wifi or in the same geographic area.

üéà **Lightweight:**
There are no native dependencies.
That also means, portals work anywhere where Dart runs: on mobile, desktop & the web.
Portals use lightweight WebSockets to communicate.

## How to use

### Create a portal

To connect two devices, you need to create a portal on each of them.

```dart
var portal = Portal(appId: 'github.com/marcelgarus/portals');
```

The `appId` can be any arbitrary string used only by your application.
It's recommended to use a url.


Optionally you can pass in an `info` string containing meta-information like your app version or something else. It will be exchanged as soon as the portals are linked.

```dart
var portal = Portal(
  appId: 'github.com/marcelgarus/portals',
  info: json.encode({ 'app_version': '1.0.0', ... }),
);
// Later, when linked:
print(portal.remoteInfo);
```

### Set up the portal

On the first device, open the portal. It will return a phrase that uniquely identifies it among other portals using your `appId`:

```dart
String phrase = await portal.open();
// TODO: Show the phrase to the user.
String key = await portal.waitForLink();
```

Let the user transcribe the `phrase` to the second user in the real world.
The second user can then link the two portals:

```dart
// TODO: Let the user enter the phrase.
String key = await portal.openAndLinkTo(phrase);
```

Now the two portals are linked.
Optionally, you can let the users compare the `key` to completely rule out man-in-the-middle attacks.

In the background, both clients try to establish a peer-to-peer connection to each other.
Wait for it on both sides by calling:

```dart
await portal.waitUntilReady();
```
</details>

### Send stuff

Anything that goes into one of the two portals comes out the other.

```dart
portal.add(something);
var somethingElse = await portal.receive();
```

All primitive types are supported by default, including `int`, `double`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`, `Set`. 

To send arbitrary Dart objects, annotate them with `@...`.
